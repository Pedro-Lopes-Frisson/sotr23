# SOTR - Project 01

## Compile and Run

We provide a bash file to compile and run the full implementation of our project (i.e. webCamCapture + main + varsDisplayer).

In the root of the project's folder:
```sh
chmod +x run.sh
sudo ./run.sh
```
Keep in mind that you may have to edit the `.env` file also located in the root of the project.

If you only want to compile the project you can use the provided Makefile by running `make` and to clean you can do `make clean`.
